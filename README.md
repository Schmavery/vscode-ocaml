# vscode-ocaml

OCaml plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  This provides syntax highlighting thanks to [ocaml.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/ocaml.tmbundle) as well as a couple of other features.  This is still very much a work in progress.

###Features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-reindenting with the help of [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent)

###In Progress:
- Integration with [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) -- type-hinting, error reporting, linting etc
- Clean everything up
